This is a proposed patch for my latest mozharness changes. This includes
everything done this far. 

For notes see 'working on/known issues' in:
https://etherpad.mozilla.org/8IoZrTUXAG

still WIP: 

1) configs are unconsolidated so major redundancy. eventually, after we see if
we need branch/arch/platformVersion specific configs, I could make an initial
config file with the duplicate code.

2) for buildbot-configs set mozharness unittests to be run on cedar

3) after WIP #1 is addressed, I would like to figure out solution for developer
configs. ATM we have a developer config for linux working but this needs to be
run for any OS.

for those with build vpn and are curious to see logs of this script running in
    testing:
